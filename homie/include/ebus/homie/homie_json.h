// JSON (de)serialization for the Homie tree, kept OUT of Property.h / Node.h.
//
// These were member functions, which forced <ArduinoJson.h> into those headers — and
// Property.h reaches driver translation units (any driver implementing
// entity_settable_callback(Property*) dereferences it). ArduinoJson is ~20,000
// preprocessed lines, so it dominated the compile cost of every such driver while being
// needed only by the $description publisher and the controller's discovery path.
//
// They are free functions rather than members precisely so the declaration can live here.
// Nothing needed private access: serialization reads public accessors and from_dict()
// writes through public setters, so no friendship is involved.
//
// Include this only where JSON is actually handled — homie/src/Device.cpp, the
// controller, and homie_json.cpp itself.
